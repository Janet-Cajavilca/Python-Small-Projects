# Python Small Projects

In this repository, I will show some small projects I am working on while learning Python. Some of these exercises are from the course **"100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023"** ([Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)).

I recommend this course because it is highly practical, and the training is the best I've had.

Here is a list of the small projects:

- [Password Generator](https://github.com/Janet-Cajavilca/Python_test/blob/main/PasswordGeneratorInPython.ipynb)
- [Band Name Generator (easy)](https://github.com/Janet-Cajavilca/Python_Small_Projects/blob/main/BandNameGenerator.ipynb)
- [Body Mass Calculation (easy)](https://github.com/Janet-Cajavilca/Python_Small_Projects/blob/main/BodyMassIndexCalculation.ipynb)
- [Leap Year Test](https://github.com/Janet-Cajavilca/Python_Small_Projects/blob/main/LeapYearTest.ipynb)
