# Python Small Projects

In this repository, I have a collection of all the projects I worked on while learning Python. Most of them are from the course **"100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023"** ([Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)).

I recommend this course because it is highly practical, and in my opinion, the training is the best I've had so far.

Here is a list of the small projects:
